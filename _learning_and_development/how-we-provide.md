Children start to learn about the world around them from the moment they are born. The care and education offered by our setting helps children to continue to do this by providing all of the children with interesting activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development.

Childrenâ€™s learning and development as set out in The Early Years Foundation Stage is defined in seven areas of learning, each area with its own unique aspects.  The areas of learning outlined in the Early Years Foundation Stage are made up of three **Prime Areas** and four **Specific Areas**.

The **Prime Areas** are particularly crucial in promoting effective learning and development during the Early Years Foundation Stage:

- Personal, Social and Emotional Development involves helping children to develop a positive sense of themselves and others; to form positive relationships and develop respect for others; to develop social skills and learn how to manage their feelings, to understand appropriate behavior in groups, and to have confidence in their own abilities.

- Communication and Language involves giving children opportunities to experience a rich language environment; to develop their confidence and skill in expressing themselves; and to speak and listen in a range of situations.

- Physical Development involves providing opportunities for young children to be active and interactive; to develop their co-ordination, control and movement.  Children must also be helped to understand the importance of physical activity, and to make healthy choices in relation to food and personal hygiene.

The **Specific Areas** include essential skills and knowledge for children to participate successfully in society.  As children progress in the Prime Areas of learning they mature and show interest in the world around them, in letters and numbers and begin to express their ideas, thoughts and feelings through arts and crafts, music, dance and story telling.

- Literacy development involves encouraging children to link sounds and letters and to begin to read and write.  Children are given access to a wide range of reading materials to ignite their interests.

- Mathematics involves providing children with opportunities to develop and improve their skills in counting, understanding and using numbers and calculating simple addition and subtraction problems, and to describe shapes, spaces and measures.

- Understanding of the World involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community through opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places technology and the environment.

- Expressive Arts and Design involves enabling children to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials as well as providing opportunities and encouragement for sharing their thoughts, ideas and feelings through a variety of activities in art, music and movement, dance, role play and design and technology.

For each area, the Early Years Foundation Stage sets out the Early Learning Goals. These goals state what it is expected that children will know and be able to do by the end of the reception year of their education.
