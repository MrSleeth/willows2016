    This place is loving, nurturing, encouraging and respecting.

    This place gives security, independence, space and time.

    This place allows risk taking, individuality, adventure and childhood.

    This place encourages independent though and deed, self expression, laughter, mud, dirt and grime.

    This place gives our children two lifelong gifts: roots and wings.

  quote: "Both of my children have loved their time at Willows. The staff are really friendly, professional and caring – a family when away from their family. The children get to do a variety of different activities including Forest School, which always went down well."

    <p>William settled in well and his transition was seamless. This wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for the staff who made William feel secure when we left him in their care. His development over these last 10 months has been amazing and he has really flourished being around other children and all of the ladies who have taken him under their wing.</p>
    <p>We visited a number of other nurseries before deciding Montessori would be beneficial to our son’s development, and I can honestly say I have been amazed and in awe of his development since he started. We are already looking forward to William’s baby sister starting in 17months time. Thank you to all the staff!</p>

  quote: "Leon has benefited greatly since he joined the Squirrel Room last year. His confidence has grown, he’s learned new things (like putting his dishes in the sink – love it!) and most of all he’s enjoyed himself. The Willows is, in our opinion, the best nursery out there, helping children to grow and learn in their own way, at their own pace."
