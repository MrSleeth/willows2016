    This place is loving, nurturing, encouraging and respecting.

    This place gives security, independence, space and time.

    This place allows risk taking, individuality, adventure and childhood.

    This place encourages independent though and deed, self expression, laughter, mud, dirt and grime.

    This place gives our children two lifelong gifts: roots and wings.

  quote: "Both of my children have loved their time at Willows. The staff are really friendly, professional and caring – a family when away from their family. The children get to do a variety of different activities including Forest School, which always went down well."

  quote: "We’ve used the Willows for over 7 years over two children and will be sad not to have a child there when our youngest starts school. It’s a lovely nurturing environment, with lots of creative outdoor and indoor activities. Highly recommended!"

  quote: "Every time I think about all the years we have dropped off 1,2 or all 3 boys at the Willows (almost 8 years!!) and how we won’t do any more come the start of school I get a bit teary and have to stop thinking about it. I can’t summarise how amazing this place is!"

  quote: "I managed to hold it together today for Charlie’s last day. Looking through his Learning Journey is a different story! He’s grown up to be an amazing little boy and we have you all to thank for playing such a big part in that. He has learned so much since his first day. You are all absolutely amazing and we love you all."

    <p>William settled in well and his transition was seamless. This wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for the staff who made William feel secure when we left him in their care. His development over these last 10 months has been amazing and he has really flourished being around other children and all of the ladies who have taken him under their wing.</p>
    <p>We visited a number of other nurseries before deciding Montessori would be beneficial to our son’s development, and I can honestly say I have been amazed and in awe of his development since he started. We are already looking forward to William’s baby sister starting in 17months time. Thank you to all the staff!</p>

  quote: "Leon has benefited greatly since he joined the Squirrel Room last year. His confidence has grown, he’s learned new things (like putting his dishes in the sink – love it!) and most of all he’s enjoyed himself. The Willows is, in our opinion, the best nursery out there, helping children to grow and learn in their own way, at their own pace."

  quote: "Jamie started at Willows when he was only 6 months old. The team in the Hedgehog Room did everything possible to make sure he was settled and happy – and that we were too! Now he doesn’t give us a second glance when we drop him off – he just wants to be playing with his friends!"
