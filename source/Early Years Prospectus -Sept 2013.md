Our Aims and Objectives

## We aim

- To provide a happy, safe and stimulating Montessori environment in which each child can develop his/her ability to its full potential.

- To help lead each child towards independence by making a wide variety of materials and experiences easily accessible without too much adult intervention.

- To help promote a positive self-image for each child by treating him/her with respect as an individual.  

- To acknowledge and respect each child's race, religion, culture, family background or special needs and reinforce a positive image of these within the setting.

- To lead by example; the teacher will never display any behaviour that they would not want the child to copy.

- To view parents as partners who work in cohesion with professionals in helping each child to learn and develop.

- To acknowledge and respect parents' wishes and their responsibility for their children, and to encourage them to take an active role in the work of the Nursery.

## Our Staff

All staff at Willows Montessori Nursery hold an Early Years qualification and are committed to participate in ongoing training to extend their knowledge.  All staff, students and volunteers have all the necessary checks including Medical and Police clearance before being employed by Willows Montessori Nursery.

Through careful selection and appointment we have achieved a team that not only has paper qualifications but also experience, commitment, enthusiasm and a genuine love of children.

## Parents and Nursery

At Willows Montessori Nursery we recognise that parents are the first and most important educators of their children and a good relationship between nursery and home is of great importance for every child in our care.  Staff are always available to discuss the progress of your child on a daily basis, and individual feedback is encouraged by appointment.  We actively encourage parents to come into Nursery.

There are always opportunities for parents to make a valuable contribution to the Nursery in the form of a special lesson, a talk, or a demonstration of a particular skill.

Regular parents evenings are organised to show the children's work, demonstrate Montessori materials and to discuss your child's development.  Regular newsletters keep parents updated on what is happening in Nursery and provide an important link between Nursery and home.

## Key Person and Your Child

Our setting uses a key person approach. This means that each member of staff has a group of children for whom she/he is particularly responsible. Your child's key person will be the person who works with you to make sure that what we provide is right for your child's particular needs and interests. When your child first starts at the setting, she/he will help your child to settle and throughout your child's time at the setting, she/he will help your child to benefit from the setting's activities.

## Children’s Learning and Development

## How we provide for development and learning

Children start to learn about the world around them from the moment they are born. The care and education offered by our setting helps children to continue to do this by providing all of the children with interesting activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development. 

Children’s learning and development as set out in The Early Years Foundation Stage is defined in seven areas of learning, each area with its own unique aspects.  The areas of learning outlined in the Early Years Foundation Stage are made up of three **Prime Areas** and four **Specific Areas**.

The **Prime Areas** are particularly crucial in promoting effective learning and development during the Early Years Foundation Stage:

- Personal, Social and Emotional Development involves helping children to develop a positive sense of themselves and others; to form positive relationships and develop respect for others; to develop social skills and learn how to manage their feelings, to understand appropriate behavior in groups, and to have confidence in their own abilities.

- Communication and Language involves giving children opportunities to experience a rich language environment; to develop their confidence and skill in expressing themselves; and to speak and listen in a range of situations.

- Physical Development involves providing opportunities for young children to be active and interactive; to develop their co-ordination, control and movement.  Children must also be helped to understand the importance of physical activity, and to make healthy choices in relation to food and personal hygiene.

The **Specific Areas** include essential skills and knowledge for children to participate successfully in society.  As children progress in the Prime Areas of learning they mature and show interest in the world around them, in letters and numbers and begin to express their ideas, thoughts and feelings through arts and crafts, music, dance and story telling.

- Literacy development involves encouraging children to link sounds and letters and to begin to read and write.  Children are given access to a wide range of reading materials to ignite their interests.

- Mathematics involves providing children with opportunities to develop and improve their skills in counting, understanding and using numbers and calculating simple addition and subtraction problems, and to describe shapes, spaces and measures.

- Understanding of the World involves guiding children to make sense of their physical world and their community through opportunities to explore, observe and find out about people, places technology and the environment.

- Expressive Arts and Design involves enabling children to explore and play with a wide range of media and materials as well as providing opportunities and encouragement for sharing their thoughts, ideas and feelings through a variety of activities in art, music and movement, dance, role play and design and technology.

For each area, the Early Years Foundation Stage sets out the Early Learning Goals. These goals state what it is expected that children will know and be able to do by the end of the reception year of their education.

## Our approach to learning and development and assessment

### Learning through play

Play helps young children to learn and develop through doing and talking, which research has shown to be the means by which young children learn to think.  Our setting uses the **Developmental Matters in the Early Years Foundation Stage** and the **Guide to the Early Years Foundation Stage in Montessori settings** to plan and provide a range of play activities which help children to make progress in each of the areas of learning and development. In some of these activities children decide how they will use the activity and, in others, an adult takes the lead in helping the children to take part in the activity.  In all activities information from both these documents has been used to decide what equipment to provide and how to provide it. 

### Assessment

We assess how young children are learning and developing by observing them frequently. We use information that we gain from observations, as well as from photographs or videos of the children, to document their progress and where this may be leading them. We believe that parents know their children best and we ask them to contribute to assessment by sharing information about what their children like to do at home and how they as parents are supporting development.

We make periodic assessment summaries of children’s achievement based on our ongoing development records. These form part of children’s records of achievement. We undertake these assessment summaries at regular intervals as well as times of transition, such as when a child moves into a different group or when they go on to school.

### Records of achievement

The setting keeps a “Learning Journey” for each child, this is a detailed file to record his / her individual progress and development.  

Staff and parents working together on their children's Learning Journey is one of the ways in which the key person and parents work in partnership. Your child's Learning Journey helps us to celebrate together her/his achievements and to work together to provide what your child needs for her/his well-being and to make progress. 

Your child's key person will work with you to keep this record. To do this you and she/he will collect information about your child's needs, activities, interests and achievements. This information will enable the key person to identify your child's stage of progress. You and the key person will then decide on how to help your child to move on to the next stage.

## Forest School

We run regular Forest School sessions for the children in our nursery and have 3 members of staff who are qualified Forest School Leaders.  

Forest schools originated in Scandinavian countries in the 1950’s, they were based on an idea that considers children’s contact with nature to be extremely important from a very early age.  

Forest Schools first began in Britain in 1993 and over recent years the numbers have steadily increased because practitioners believe that this practical way of learning is of benefit to all children.  In the forest children are developing at their own speed and in their own time, gaining an awareness of the outdoors and the environment.  The outdoor learning environment has the potential to expand children’s experiences and broaden their capacity to learn and develop in unique ways and the more relaxed and freer atmosphere provides a contrast to the classroom environment. 

Research showed that children who participate in Forest School frequently show improved physical and motor skills, improved language and communication skills, improved social skills including team working, improved knowledge and understanding of the environment, increased confidence and self belief and increased motivation and concentration. 

Our Forest School sessions are structured however children are encouraged to choose for themselves the activities they wish to participate in, including activities such as story telling, digging, climbing, mini beast hunting, den building, mapping, plant, bird, insect and animal identification, fire building, cooking on a fire, sawing logs and much more.

## Working together for your children

In our setting we maintain the ratio of adults to children in the setting that is set through the Welfare Requirements. We also have volunteer parent helpers and childcare students where possible to complement these ratios. This helps us to:
- give time and attention to each child;
- talk with the children about their interests and activities;
- help children to experience and benefit from the activities we provide; and
- allow the children to explore and be adventurous in safety.

## Safeguarding children

Our setting has a duty under the law to help safeguard children against suspected or actual “significant harm”.

Our employment practices ensure children against the likelihood of abuse in our setting and we have a procedure in place for managing complaints or allegations against a member of staff.

Our way of working with children and their parents ensures that we are aware of any problems that may emerge and can offer support, including referral to appropriate agencies when necessary, to help families in difficulty.

## Special Educational Needs

As part of the setting’s policy to make sure that its provision meets the needs of each individual child, we take account of any children with special educational needs.  The setting works to the requirements of the 1993 Education Act and The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001).

Our Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator is **Jenni Cummings**.

## Food and Drink

The Nursery sessions include the provision of breakfast, mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack.  

Hot cooked lunches and teas are available at a small additional cost.

## Starting at Willows Montessori Nursery

We want your child to feel happy and safe with us.  To make sure that this is the case, the staff will work with you to decide on how to help your child settle into the setting.  We have a policy about helping children settle into the setting a copy of this is available from Jenni Cummings (Nursery Manager).

## Clothing

We provide protective clothing for the children when they play with messy activities.  We encourage children to gain the skills that help them to be independent and look after themselves.  These include taking themselves to the toilet and taking off, and putting on outdoor clothes.  Clothing that is easy for them to manage will help them to do this.

We hope that you and your child enjoy being members of our setting and that you both find taking part in our activities interesting and stimulating.  The staff are always ready to talk with you about your ideas, views or questions.
