## Our Session Times and Fees

The fees are payable monthly in advance.  Fees must be still paid if children are absent without notice for a short period of time.  If your child has to be absent over a long period of time, talk to Ethel Mills who is the Nursery Principal.

We are in receipt of nursery education funding for three and four year olds.  From the term after their 3rd birthday all children are entitled to receive 15 hours per week of free nursery education during term time.  Where funding is not received the following rates apply:-

The 2 - 5 years' rate applies from the month following your child's second birthday.

## Food and Drink

The Nursery sessions include the provision of breakfast, mid-morning and mid-afternoon snack.  

Hot cooked lunches and teas are available at a small additional cost.

## Starting at Willows Montessori Nursery

We want your child to feel happy and safe with us.  To make sure that this is the case, the staff will work with you to decide on how to help your child settle into the setting.  We have a policy about helping children settle into the setting a copy of this is available from Jenni Cummings (Nursery Manager).

## Clothing

We provide protective clothing for the children when they play with messy activities.  We encourage children to gain the skills that help them to be independent and look after themselves.  These include taking themselves to the toilet and taking off, and putting on outdoor clothes.  Clothing that is easy for them to manage will help them to do this.

We hope that you and your child enjoy being members of our setting and that you both find taking part in our activities interesting and stimulating.  The staff are always ready to talk with you about your ideas, views or questions.
