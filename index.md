# Welcome to Willows

Willows Montessori Nursery is a small, friendly, child centred Nursery set in the beautiful surroundings of Old Ryton Village.  We have a fully secure outdoor garden for play and outdoor learning activities.

We realise that you want the best care and educational start for your child and it is our objective to meet these requirements by providing high quality full and part time care and education for children from birth to 5 years.

> We at Willows Montessori Nursery are committed to providing a caring, stable, safe and welcoming environment in which each child can develop the skills needed for life, and will be encouraged to achieve their full potential.
> We will equip and maintain this environment to include various materials from the Montessori method of education, and will dedicate ourselves to implementing this method, so enriching each child's educational experience.
