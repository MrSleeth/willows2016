All staff at Willows Montessori Nursery hold an Early Years qualification and are committed to participate in ongoing training to extend their knowledge.  All staff, students and volunteers have all the necessary checks including Medical and Police clearance before being employed by Willows Montessori Nursery.

Through careful selection and appointment we have achieved a team that not only has paper qualifications but also experience, commitment, enthusiasm and a genuine love of children.
