All staff at Willows Montessori Nursery hold an Early Years qualification and are committed to participate in ongoing training to extend their knowledge.  All staff, students and volunteers have all the necessary checks including Medical and Police clearance before being employed by Willows Montessori Nursery.

Through careful selection and appointment we have achieved a team that not only has paper qualifications but also experience, commitment, enthusiasm and a genuine love of children.

## Key Person and Your Child

Our setting uses a key person approach. This means that each member of staff has a group of children for whom she/he is particularly responsible. Your child's key person will be the person who works with you to make sure that what we provide is right for your child's particular needs and interests. When your child first starts at the setting, she/he will help your child to settle and throughout your child's time at the setting, she/he will help your child to benefit from the setting's activities.

## Working together for your children

In our setting we maintain the ratio of adults to children in the setting that is set through the Welfare Requirements. We also have volunteer parent helpers and childcare students where possible to complement these ratios. This helps us to:
- give time and attention to each child;
- talk with the children about their interests and activities;
- help children to experience and benefit from the activities we provide; and
- allow the children to explore and be adventurous in safety.

## Safeguarding children

Our setting has a duty under the law to help safeguard children against suspected or actual “significant harm”.

Our employment practices ensure children against the likelihood of abuse in our setting and we have a procedure in place for managing complaints or allegations against a member of staff.

Our way of working with children and their parents ensures that we are aware of any problems that may emerge and can offer support, including referral to appropriate agencies when necessary, to help families in difficulty.

## Special Educational Needs

As part of the setting’s policy to make sure that its provision meets the needs of each individual child, we take account of any children with special educational needs.  The setting works to the requirements of the 1993 Education Act and The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001).

Our Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator is **Jenni Cummings**.
