All staff at Willows Montessori Nursery hold an Early Years qualification and are committed to participate in ongoing training to extend their knowledge.  All staff, students and volunteers have all the necessary checks including Medical and Police clearance before being employed by Willows Montessori Nursery.

Through careful selection and appointment we have achieved a team that not only has paper qualifications but also experience, commitment, enthusiasm and a genuine love of children.

## Key Person and Your Child

Our setting uses a key person approach. This means that each member of staff has a group of children for whom she/he is particularly responsible. Your child's key person will be the person who works with you to make sure that what we provide is right for your child's particular needs and interests. When your child first starts at the setting, she/he will help your child to settle and throughout your child's time at the setting, she/he will help your child to benefit from the setting's activities.
