## Our aims and objectives are

- To provide a happy, safe and stimulating Montessori environment in which each child can develop his/her ability to its full potential.

- To help lead each child towards independence by making a wide variety of materials and experiences easily accessible without too much adult intervention.

- To help promote a positive self-image for each child by treating him/her with respect as an individual.

- To acknowledge and respect each child's race, religion, culture, family background or special needs and reinforce a positive image of these within the setting.

- To lead by example; the teacher will never display any behaviour that they would not want the child to copy.

- To view parents as partners who work in cohesion with professionals in helping each child to learn and develop.

- To acknowledge and respect parents' wishes and their responsibility for their children, and to encourage them to take an active role in the work of the Nursery.
