# The Badger Room

Our Badger Room is equipped for a maximum of twenty-four children per session, aged from 3 to 5 years of age, and our staff to child ratio is 1:8. This is our pre-school room and is where children will stay until they leave us to join Reception class.
The Badger Room has an extensive range of Montessori materials in all areas of learning, as well as a home corner for role-play, cosy reading area by the window and an area for messy play including painting, glue and stick and water play. 
Adult led activities take place during the morning and afternoon sessions should children wish to take part.
Children in the Badger Room also benefit from free-flow access to our well equipped outdoor area.
