Our Foxes Den is for a maximum of 12 children per session, aged 2â€“3 years, and our staff to child ratio is 1:4.

The Foxes Den is set in the grounds of our bottom garden, away from our main nursery building, and has a natural feel to it. The building has its own small cloakroom and bathroom facilities, as well as a little kitchen as a separate section of the classroom. The front face of the building boasts a number of large windows, filling the classroom with natural light, and benefits from a small veranda which the children can access via double doors direct from the classroom.

All furniture and equipment within the classroom are designed for use by two year olds. The children access a range of early Montessori materials in all areas of learning, as well as activities such as building blocks, cars, animals, loose parts and puzzles. The classroom contains a role-play area and a cosy area for enjoying songs and stories. 
Adult-led activities take place during the morning and afternoon sessions should children wish to take part.
