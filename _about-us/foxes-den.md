title: The Foxes Den
order: 2
---

The Foxes Den is equipped for a maximum of twelve children per session, aged from 2 to around 3 years of age, and our staff to child ratio is 1:4.

The Foxes Den is set in the grounds of our bottom garden, away from the main nursery building, and has a very natural feel to it. It is a wooden structure with its own kitchen, toilet area and verandah and the children benefit from free-flow access to the garden. We love to play outdoors in all weathers and our outdoor area is as well equipped as indoors. The Foxes Den has a range of early Montessori materials in the areas of literacy, maths, sensorial, cultural and activities of everyday living.

The layout of the Foxes Den is very cosy, with a cushioned reading corner, home corner for role play, construction area, cut and stick trolley and a number of tables for the children to work with materials independently.

Adult led activities take place during the morning and afternoon sessions should children wish to take part.
