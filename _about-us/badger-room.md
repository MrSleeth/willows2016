Our Badger Room is equipped for a maximum of twenty-four children per session, aged from 3 to 5 years of age, and our staff to child ratio is 1:8. This is our pre-school room and is where children will stay until they leave us to join Reception class.

As well as following the ethos of promoting independence and following children's interests, the Badger Room has an extensive range of Montessori materials in all areas of learning. Our classroom also has an area for arts, crafts and messy play, a role-play area and book corner. Children are encouraged to be independent in all aspects of nursery life, including helping to prepare snacks and meals and tending to their own self-care needs wherever possible. 


Adult led activities take place during the morning and afternoon sessions should children wish to take part. Children in the Badger Room also benefit from free-flow access to our well equipped outdoor area.
