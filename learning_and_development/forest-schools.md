We run regular Forest School sessions for the children in our nursery and have 3 members of staff who are qualified Forest School Leaders.  

Forest schools originated in Scandinavian countries in the 1950’s, they were based on an idea that considers children’s contact with nature to be extremely important from a very early age.  

Forest Schools first began in Britain in 1993 and over recent years the numbers have steadily increased because practitioners believe that this practical way of learning is of benefit to all children.  In the forest children are developing at their own speed and in their own time, gaining an awareness of the outdoors and the environment.  The outdoor learning environment has the potential to expand children’s experiences and broaden their capacity to learn and develop in unique ways and the more relaxed and freer atmosphere provides a contrast to the classroom environment.

Research showed that children who participate in Forest School frequently show improved physical and motor skills, improved language and communication skills, improved social skills including team working, improved knowledge and understanding of the environment, increased confidence and self belief and increased motivation and concentration.

Our Forest School sessions are structured however children are encouraged to choose for themselves the activities they wish to participate in, including activities such as story telling, digging, climbing, mini beast hunting, den building, mapping, plant, bird, insect and animal identification, fire building, cooking on a fire, sawing logs and much more.
