## Age of Admittance

Children are welcomed from 3 months to 5 years
Children are required to be registered for a minimum of 2 sessions per week (i.e. 1 full day, or 2 mornings or 2 afternoons).

## Fees Schedule:

- Fees are payable in accordance with the Fee Schedule.  Fees quoted are per child.
- Where 2 or more children from one family attend the Nursery for 2 days or more per week, the eldest child will be entitled to a 10% reduction on their monthly fees.
- Fees are payable on the first day of each calendar month in advance, payable by cash, cheque, childcare vouchers or standing order.
- Fees are calculated by multiplying the weekly fee by 51 weeks and dividing by 12 calendar months.
- We reserve the right to charge an administration fee of £10 per week for any late payments.

## Holidays, Absences and Notice:

- The Nursery is open for 51 weeks of the year.  The Nursery is closed for approximately 1 week over the Christmas – New Year period, and all statutory bank holidays.
- Our quoted fee schedule has taken into account a 2 week holiday entitlement throughout a year and all bank holidays and the Christmas – New Year period.  This is reflected in the quoted fees and there is therefore no reduction in fees during holiday periods.
- Fees are payable at the full rate for all periods of absence, including holidays and sickness.
- Four week’s notice is required by either party to terminate a child’s place in the Nursery, or 4 week’s in lieu of notice.

## Clothing and Personal Items:

- Each child should have sufficient clothes for their daily needs plus a spare set in the event of accidents.
- Parents are asked to ensure that a child does not bring valuable items with them as the Nursery cannot accept responsibility for any subsequent loss or damage.
- Parents are asked to provide sunhats and an adequate sunblock during summer months and wellington boots and suitable outdoor clothing during the winter to ensure that the child can benefit from outdoor pursuits.
- For children who are not fully toilet trained parents are asked to provide nappies, baby wipes and creams.

## Sickness and Illness

Any child who has, or develops, an infectious illness must be kept at home.  This includes conditions such as vomitting, diarrhoea, discharges from eyes or mouth, conjunctivitis, sore throat and obvious rashes.  Fees are payable at the full rate during the period of sickness absence from the Nursery.

Any child suffering from vomiting or diarrhoea must be kept at home until clear of symptoms for a minimum period of 48 hours.
