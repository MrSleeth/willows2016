At Willows Montessori Nursery we recognise that parents are the first and most important educators of their children and a good relationship between nursery and home is of great importance for every child in our care.  Staff are always available to discuss the progress of your child on a daily basis, and individual feedback is encouraged by appointment.  We actively encourage parents to come into Nursery.

There are always opportunities for parents to make a valuable contribution to the Nursery in the form of a special lesson, a talk, or a demonstration of a particular skill.

Regular parents evenings are organised to show the children's work, demonstrate Montessori materials and to discuss your child's development.  Regular newsletters keep parents updated on what is happening in Nursery and provide an important link between Nursery and home.
